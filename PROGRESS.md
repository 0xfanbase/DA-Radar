## Log

### 2026-07-09 — Phase 1 kickoff

- Read `HK_REG_RADAR_BUILD_SPEC.md` in full.
- Confirmed repo state: one commit, MIT LICENSE only, branch `claude/hk-radar-phase-1-mzlnxx`.
- Verified live, by direct fetch, that all target RSS feeds are valid RSS 2.0:
  - SFC: `Press-releases`, `Circulars`, `Consultations-and-Conclusions` (all at
    `https://www.sfc.hk/en/RSS-Feeds/...`, no `.xml` suffix).
  - HKMA: `rss_press-release.xml`, `rss_circulars.xml`, `rss_speeches.xml`, `rss_guidelines.xml`,
    `rss_legislative-council-issues.xml`, `rss_consultations.xml` (all at
    `https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/other-information/rss/...`).
- Spawned a Fable-model agent as project-manager reviewer for scope/risk sign-off at kickoff and
  at two build checkpoints (see "PM checkpoints" below).
- Scaffolded repo structure, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, empty schema-conformant
  `data/ledger.json` / `data/queue.json` (commit `chore: scaffold repo structure...`).
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (this phase's governance doc, per spec §11) and this file.

*(Further entries appended as each build stage lands — config, schemas, watcher modules, tests,
the live watcher run and its idempotent re-run, and final sign-off.)*

## PM checkpoints (Fable)

*(Recorded here as they happen: kickoff directives, checkpoint sign-offs, any corrective
directives issued.)*
